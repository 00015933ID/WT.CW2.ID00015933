Name of project is Markdown Blog.

Markdown Blog is a web application designed to facilitate the creation of articles with title, description, and Markdown formatting. This platform aims to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface for composing and publishing articles online. By leveraging the Markdown syntax, users can easily format their content without needing to learn complex HTML or CSS.

## About the App

Users can create new articles by providing a title, description, and content using Markdown syntax. This allows for flexible formatting options such as headings, lists, links, and more. Once an article is created, users have the ability to edit and update its content as needed. This enables authors to refine their articles over time or make corrections as necessary. Markdown Blog offers a preview function that allows users to preview their articles in real-time before publishing. This helps authors ensure that their content appears as intended with proper formatting. After creating and editing their articles, users can publish them to make them publicly available on the platform. Published articles can be viewed by other users and shared via a unique URL.
